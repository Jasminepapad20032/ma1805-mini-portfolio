## 0.4.Media - Resonant Image

This piece reimagines a single image, Swirls.jpg, through gentle digital transformations.
By cycling filters and adjusting transparency, this work invites reflection on how media
presentation alters the perception of the viewer. Also how a shift in tone and contrast 
can entirely reshape emotion and meaning.

Interaction is minimal yet deliberate:
   - Click - cycles visual filters (NONE, GRAY, POSTERIZE, INVERT).
   - Move mouse - adjusts transparency, revealing layers of depth.

The faint viginette and scanline overlay echo physical media surfaces, screens, prints 
and film, reminding all of us that every digital image carries its own traces of materiality
and culture.
