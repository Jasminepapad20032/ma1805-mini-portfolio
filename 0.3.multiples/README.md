## 0.3.Multiples - Digital Pulse 

This sketch explores the concept repetition and rhythm through a dynamic grid of shapes. Using arrays, loops, and conditionals, each cell has its own "pulse" that shifts in speed, brightness, and form. 
The alternating circles and squares create a digital rhythym that feels alive which is a visual metaphor for the repetitice patterns of modern life. The faint grid overlay references Rosalind Krauss's idea of the grid as both order and constraint.
Each mouse clik changes the visual mode, introducing variation within structure. The result is an amazing system that moves and breathes, reflecting the sublte pulse of everyday digital activity.
