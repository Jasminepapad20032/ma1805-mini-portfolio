## 0.2.Movement - Jasmine Papadopoulos

This sketch explores movement through variables and randomness. A global counter (count++) and short random lines create a visible rhythm. While three rectangles fall at indepentent speeds stores in arrays and they wrap to the top, which forms a looping pattern of motion. Mouse clicks add translucent circles that trace the viewers cursor, which makes this interactive aswell.
